- 👋 Hi, I’m @marsyb
- 👀 I’m interested in finding out which part of development speaks to me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on the Odin Project
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... probably need to wait until I can write a line of code for that
- 📫 How to reach me ... is there a message feature on here?
