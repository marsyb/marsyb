- 👋 Hi, I’m @marsyb
- 👀 I’m interested in seeing what's out there in the coding world
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on the The Complete Web Development Course by Udemy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... probably need to wait until I can write a line of code for that
- 📫 How to reach me ... is there a message feature on here?
